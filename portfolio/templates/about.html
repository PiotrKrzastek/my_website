                    Hey! Iâ€™m Piotr, a junior developer whoâ€™s been passionate about coding since I was young. These days, Iâ€™m focused on building web applications and growing into a full-stack developer.
                    Most of my work so far has been with Python and Flask, but Iâ€™ve also been picking up JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB along the way.
                    I love experimenting with projects that challenge me and push me to learn something new.

                <h2 class="main__section-header">My achievements and projects</h2>
                <p class="main__section-content">
                    Right now, Iâ€™m working on a school inventory system using Flask and MongoDB, while also sharpening my skills through courses and coding challenges on Codewars (currently 5 kyu ðŸ‘¾).
                    Iâ€™ve built apps like <strong>NoteUp</strong>, a simple note-taking app, and Iâ€™m slowly building up my portfolio piece by piece.
                    Even though I enjoy back-end development the most, Iâ€™m also working on improving my front-end skills so I can create full-stack projects from start to finish.

            <h2 class="main__section-header" >Future goals</h2>
            <p class="main__section-content">
                Iâ€™m excited to keep growing as a developer and dive deeper into front-end frameworks like React.
                Iâ€™m also curious about mobile app development and even exploring languages like Rust.
                Outside of coding, I enjoy solving puzzles and  coding challenges.
