                NoteUP is a simple web application where users can add notes to document their daily life. Itâ€™s built with HTML, CSS, Python, and Flask. This was my first project from the Udemy course
                <a class="main__section-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/web-developer-bootcamp-flask-python/">Web Developer Bootcamp with Flask and Python in 2024</a>

                <p class="main__section-content">
                    NoteUP allows users to create and view their notes. The interface is clean and user-friendly, making it easy to manage notes efficiently.
                    The app uses Flask to handle routing and server-side logic, while MongoDB is used for storing notes persistently.
                    Overall, NoteUP serves as a foundational project that helped me understand the basics of web development and full-stack application architecture.

                    Since this was my first project, the design is quite simple and minimalistic, focusing more on functionality than aesthetics.
                    It only contains one main page where users can add and view their notes.

            <p class="main__section-content">
                To run NoteUP locally, make sure you have Python and Flask installed. Clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory.
                You will also need to have MongoDB set up and running on your machine or in the cloud to store the notes. All neccessary libraries can be installed via pip using requirements.txt file.
                in your .env you need to set MONGO_URI variable to your local MongoDB instance and a SECRET_KEY variable containing your own secret key.
                to run simply create a file main.py and import app to use app.run()

            <p class="main__section-content">
                Since NoteUP is a simple note-taking application without user authentication, security measures are minimal.
                For production use, it is recommended to implement user authentication and authorization to ensure that notes are private and secure.
                Additionally, using HTTPS for secure data transmission is advisable.

                If you encounter any issues while running NoteUP, ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and that your MongoDB instance is accessible.
                Check the console for any error messages that can provide insights into what might be going wrong.
                If problems persist, consider reaching out via the GitHub repository's issue tracker for assistance.
                I will listen to any issues reported there and try to help as much as I can. After any question I will add a FAQ section here.
